# Survey form with React

The focus here was to use React state and building controlling forms, with a summary.

## The problemüßê

To make a survey that consist of at least 3 questions.At least one question should use radio buttons. At least one question should use a select dropdown.
I hade put extra effort in understanding starte, and what to pas in as props and the destrucuring. 

Had I gotten more time, I would bring in more interactive elements such as, range-sliders, check boxes and more questions. Also workt more on the visuals with pictures that show in connection with the answers and made the forms questions appear after each other, giving the user a feeling of fills in the form step by step. Would also have a reset button.

Used: React.js, JavaScript, css
